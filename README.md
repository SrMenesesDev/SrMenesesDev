## Want a tailored version?
If you'd like, I can:
- Replace placeholders with your real content,
- Reorganize the layout for hiring vs. portfolio focus,
- Produce a short or long variant (one‑page or expanded),
- Add localized versions (e.g., English + Portuguese),
- Generate the exact README markdown ready to paste into your profile.
